![Log Graph](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/LogFcns_Files/image001.png)  
From this graph you can see that if the log/ln of something is between 0 and 1 (some fraction) the result is always 1. This is useful for stats

## Linear Algebra Rules
##### Vector operations. (not matrix!)
Dot product (scalar singular value)   
(x,y,z) dot (a,b,c) = ax+by+cz
  
Cross Product (returns a vector)  
(x,y,z) x (a,b,c) = (yc-bz, az-xc, bx-ay)  
Property: vxw = -(wxv)
  
Determinant:  
[a b]  
[c d]       is ad-bc
